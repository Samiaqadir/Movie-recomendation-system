# Movie-recomendation-system
 A movie recommendation system suggests personalized movies to users based on their preferences, viewing history, and ratings. It analyzes data such as genre, actors, or past choices to predict films users are likely to enjoy. 
A movie recommendation system using AI leverages machine learning algorithms to suggest films to users based on their preferences and behavior. AI-driven systems analyze vast amounts of user data, including watch history, ratings, and demographic information, to predict what movies a user might enjoy. Common AI techniques used include collaborative filtering (relying on user behavior and ratings), content-based filtering (recommending similar movies based on attributes), and hybrid methods that combine both approaches. AI systems improve over time by learning from user interactions, offering increasingly accurate and personalized recommendations. This enhances user experience by making it easier to discover new content tailored to individual tastes.
